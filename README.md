# Teach me something

I am learning Haskell on [Twitch][twitch]. I am also interested in creating
educational material for learning Haskell.

This repository will contain all of the _episodes_ from this series. Each
episode will be placed in its own directory. Each directory will contain a
`README.md` file explaining some topic with an exercise (one or more) to
complete and should include an example solution.

Are you interested in adding an episode? See [Contributing](#contributing)

## Episodes

No episodes yet :(

## Contributing

Any topic will be considered as long as it can be completed in Haskell or has
something do with Haskell. For example, introduce a type class, show me how to
start a project with cabal/stack, learn something about GHCi, introduce a
library, introduce some syntax, or introduce a data structure. Ideally, users
shouldn't spend more than 1 hour on your episode.

To include your episode create a pull request in this repository containing a
`README.md` with a description of your episode. When it is done please tag me
for review. If your PR is chosen, we can schedule a time for us to work on the
episode streamed live on [my channel][twitch]. I live in the Eastern Time Zone
(GMT-4) but we can work outside of my normal streaming schedule if necessary.
After we complete the episode live we will clean up anything necessary in the
PR, move it to its own directory, add example solution/s, release the video on
on [my youtube][youtube], and [publish the episode](#episodes).
