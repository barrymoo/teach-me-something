# Teach me something

I am learning Haskell on [Twitch][twitch]. I am also interested in creating
educational material for learning Haskell. This repository is an attempt
to do both!

The series "Teach me something about Haskell" will contain lessons (in
this repository) and corresponding videos on YouTube. I will use
_lesson_ to refer to the text and _episode_ to refer to the video.
Each lesson will be placed in its own directory, containing:

- a `README.md` file explaining some topic with an exercise (one or more)
- an example solution to the exercise
- a link to a video where I discuss the lesson with the author and solve
  the exercise/s

Are you interested in adding a lesson? See [Contributing](#contributing)

## Past Episodes

No episodes yet :(

## Contributing

Any topic will be considered as long as it can be completed in Haskell or has
something do with Haskell. For example, introduce a type class, show us how to
start a project with cabal, show us something interesting in GHCi, introduce a
library, introduce some syntax, or introduce a data structure. Ideally, we
shouldn't spend more than 1 hour on your lesson.

To include your lesson create a pull request in this repository containing a
`README.md` with a description and the content. When it is done please tag me
for review. If your PR is chosen, we can schedule a time for us to work on the
episode streamed live on [my channel][twitch]. I live in the Eastern Time Zone
(GMT-4) but we can work outside of my normal streaming schedule if necessary.
After we complete the live episode we will clean up anything necessary in the
PR, move it to its own directory, add example solution/s, release the video on
on [my youtube][youtube], and [publish the episode](#episodes).

## Why should you contribute?

Why not? Maybe your lesson will help someone better understand Haskell.
